Grub themes will give a modern look to the Grub2 menu during boot.

# What is Grub?

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader package developed to support multiple operating systems and allow the user to select among them during boot-up. 
This program is responsible for detecting and loading any OS on your personal computer.
In common cases, You have simply installed Linux with Windows or any other Linux on your machine in a dual boot. The Linux installer will automatically detect your other installation and write the configuration file for you.
So When you turn on your PC GRUB comes up and shows you a menu to select if you like to boot either Windows or Linux.
That's all. 

# What this theme do?

It customizes the original GRUB menu and give it the look the user wants. The original GRUB menu doesn't look very good but the best thing is that the user can customize the way he/she wants. 
This theme helps them do it without messing with the system. Messing with GRUB can be painful if you didn't do it correctly, this is where this theme comes and simply customize it for you.
