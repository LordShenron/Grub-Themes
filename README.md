# What is Grub?

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader package developed to support multiple operating systems and allow the user to select among them during boot-up. 
This program is responsible for detecting and loading any OS on your personal computer.
In common cases, You have simply installed Linux with Windows or any other Linux on your machine in a dual boot. The Linux installer will automatically detect your other installation and write the configuration file for you.
So When you turn on your PC GRUB comes up and shows you a menu to select if you like to boot either Windows or Linux.
That's all.
